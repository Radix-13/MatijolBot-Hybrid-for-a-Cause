# MatijolBot-Hybrid-for-a-Cause
This is an river-cleaning robot can move on both water and land, efficiently collecting waste and pollution. Its amphibious design makes it easily deployable, offering an eco-friendly solution for pollution control in hard-to-reach areas
# Abstract : 
An amphibious robot called MatiJolBot is created to collect waste from rivers and their banks in an efficient manner. In difficult-to-reach areas, the robot tackles pressing environmental issues brought on by river pollution by switching between aquatic and land navigation with ease. Everything about MatiJolBot (concept, process, workflow) is described in this project focusing on the environment and also the costing as one vehicle can do multiple tasks.
